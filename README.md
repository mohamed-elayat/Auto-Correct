## About

One of the projects for our OOP class. The program initially reads a text file that serves as a dictionnary.
All the words are stored in a HashSet.  
&nbsp;  
After that, the program can open text files and display them in the TextArea to allow users to check errors. Any words that
are not in the dictionnary file are considered errors. They're then highlighted in
red.  
&nbsp;  
Upon clicking on the highlighted word, the user is shown the 5 words in the dictionnary that are closest 
to the incorrect word. The user can click on one of the suggested words to perform the auto-correction.
After performing the desired corrections, the user can save his file on his computer. 
  

## Running the program
